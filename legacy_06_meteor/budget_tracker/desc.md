Budget tracker requirements
Create a budget tracker app that allows user to keep track of incomes/expenses for several projects (like vacation, business project, etc.). 

The app should:
- be an iOS app
- save the data in the user device
- allow the user to add multiple projects (you can decide to limit the number)
- in the main page it should display a summary of each project containing:
  - the initial budget
  - the current balance
  - the percentage and amount of the expenses by category
- you should be able to edit and remove the title and initial budget (both at once or individually)
- clicking on each trip should show all individual expenses and incomes
- you should be able to add each expenses with the amount, name and a category choice
- all income should default to the category income
- you should be able to add, delete and update expenses, incomes and categories
- there should be some initial categories


Please refer to the example to get an idea of how it works
