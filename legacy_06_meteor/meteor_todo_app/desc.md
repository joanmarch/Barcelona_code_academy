Our amazing todo app is almost done however there are a few tweaks you can make.


- Add the function update and the method where they need to be.
- Pass the update function to our child component through props then call it from there.
- Add an  hidden input field that can be shown on click to update the selected todo.
- Also hide the delete and edit icons  so that these are shown on mouse enter and hidden on mouse out
- Hovering on the icon update it should make it red
- Hovering on the icon delete it should make it blue
