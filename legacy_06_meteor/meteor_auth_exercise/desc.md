Create an App component which should have:

– A NavBar component 
– in the navbar component there should be at list 2 pages, plus the auth pages (
login, logout, register)
– the user must be able to register, login, and logout.
– then also create a private page which should only be accessible once logged in.
– you should still show the link to that page in the navbar but when the navbar is clicked you should display an error message saying to the user that he must be logged in to see it, of course the once the user is logged in that page should be available.

Use the message components you should have created in the create reusable components lecture.
