// Please write your solution in the corresponding folder/file to make them available for the testing

//IN ORDER TO TEST YOUR SOLUTIONS YOU SHOULD RUN THE FOLLOWING COMAND IN THE TERMINAL:

// First time just once:
// npm install
// This will install needed npm packages for testing

// To test an exercise:

//npm run test-single -- test/'NAME_OF_THE_TEST_FILE_YOU_ARE_TESTING'

// example :
// if you are doing exercise 1 of block 1 it should be 

//npm run test-single -- test/b1exercise1.test.js

// Then simply change the block/exercises numbers, like for Block 02 Exercise 3 run this:

//npm run test-single -- test/b2exercise3.test.js

EXERCISE 1:

//create a variable called apple and assign to it a value of 5
//then create another variable called apple2 and give to it a value of 15.
//and finally sum the together and return their sum.







EXERCISE 2:

//create 2 variables:
//a , b
//assign 10 to a and 24 to b

//return the total of the multiplication of a and b








EXERCISE 3:

//Age calculator

//Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!

//Store your birth year in a variable.

//Store a future year in a variable.


//Output the age!








EXERCISE 4:

//Ever wondered how much a "lifetime supply of Tea you will need?"
//let's find out!!!
//store  your current age in a variable
//store your estimated end age in a variable
//store how many teas you drink per day on average
//calculate how many you will need until the end!

//Output the result!


EXERCISE 5:

//Define a function called compare which takes 2 arguments, and returns true if the first is bigger than the second and false if is not.
// example 
//compare(10, 34)
// false
// compare(100, 34)
// true

EXERCISE 6:

//Define a function called compare which takes 2 arguments, and returns true if the first is equal to the second and false if is not (strict equality).

// example 
//compare(10, 34)
// false
// compare(100, 100)
// true
// compare(100, '100')
// false


EXERCISE 7:

// create one varibale a, and assign it a value of 3.
// create a function called isEven which takes 1 arg: a,  and return true if the argument passed is even and false if is odd.

// example call 
// isEven(7)
// false
// isEven(2)
// true








EXERCISE 8:

//knowing that the minimum age for driving a 50cc scooter is 15 define a variable called age
// and then return true if you are old enough to drive a scooter and false if you are not








EXERCISE 9:

//define the name of the user
//define the year of birth of the user
//return his name and current age in a sentence like in the example:
// ******EXAMPLE******
//Hello Jason, you are 34 years old









EXERCISE 10:

//define the user year of birth
//assign the current year to a variable.
//then return the following message, replacing the word *'DAYS'* with the actual value

// you have lived for *'DAYS'* days already!








EXERCISE 11:

//It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here:
http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html

// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output the result.
// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output the result.
